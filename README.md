# d1-animations
This project recreates the original Diablo 1 sprite animations for the purpose of preservation.
Each animation is hand-crafted to match the original frames as faithfully as possible.
All animations are exported in BVH format and released under the CC0 license.

The skeleton is fully compatible with humanoid models generated by [Meshy.ai](meshy.ai).

Contributions are welcome.
